        The superstitions surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture,
        but black cats have positive associations in the Celtic nations and
        Japanese folklore. Black cats were sacred in Celtic mythology. Scottish
        lore holds that a black cat's arrival at a new home signifies
        prosperity, while Welsh lore states that a black cat brings good health:
        <br />
        <span>
          <strong>
            Cath ddu, mi glywais dd‚Äôwedyd, A fedr swyno hefyd, A chadw‚Äôr teulu
            lle mae‚Äôn byw O afael pob rhyw glefyd.
            <br />
            A black cat, I‚Äôve heard it said, Can charm all ill away, And keep
            the house wherein she dwells From fever‚Äôs deadly sway.
            <br />
            ‚ÄîA Welsh folklore rhyme, 1896
          </strong>
        </span>
        <br />
        However, both the Gaels and Celtic Britons had traditions of feral and
        sometimes malevolent black cats. In Scottish mythology, a fairy known as
        the Cat s√¨th takes the form of a black cat, while in Welsh mythology the
        monstrous Cath Palug grew from a black kitten. In England, as with other
        Germanic cultures, some areas would associate black cats with witches
        and bad luck.
        <br />
        The mix of positive and negative associations in Great Britain may have
        given rise to the later belief that black cats were omens of both good
        and bad luck. One tradition states that if a black cat walks towards
        someone, it is said to bring good fortune, but if it walks away, it
        takes the good luck with it. This tradition was reversed at sea where
        18th century pirates came to believe that a black cat would bring bad
        luck if it walks towards someone, and good luck if it walks away from
        someone. It was also believed that if a black cat walks onto a ship and
        then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.
        Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have
        many suitors.
